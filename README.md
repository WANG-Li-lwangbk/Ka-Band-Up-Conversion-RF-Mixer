**A Ka-band upconversion RF mixer operating from 24 to 30 GHz in 40-nm CMOS process**

The RF mixer is integrated in our 4-element Ka-band phased-array transmitter, published in ESSERC 2024. Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10719557

**Main Feature:**
- High gain (14 dB)
- Large output swing (900mV amplitude)
- Symmetric layout for the Gilbert cell.

**Techniques:**
- Current-source-less topology for large output swing
- Transformer-based compact matching
